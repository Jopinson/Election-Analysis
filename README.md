# Election-Analysis
I was challenged to create a program that could audit election data to determine things such as the winning canidate or the county with the highest voter turnout.  
## Election Audit Results
*There were 369,711 total votes spread across three counties and three canidates.
- Jefferson County with 38,855 votes, equaling 10.5% of the votes.
- Denver County with 306,055 votes, equaling 82.8% of the votes.
- Arapahoe County with 24,801 votes, equaling 6.7% of the votes. 
- Denver county had the highest number of voters
- Charles Casper Stockham recieved 85,213 votes for 23% of the total votes
- Diana DeGette recieved 272,892 votes for 73.8% of the total votes
- Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 11,606 votes for 3.1% of the total votes

## Election Audit Summary
In conclusion, this script provides a quick and efficient way to sort thru large quanities of data. This script could be modified to search and sort thru more than just three counties. It can also be used for much smaller elections, such as a sheriff or comptroller.
